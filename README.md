# rpn-calculator
This is a [Reverse Polish notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator that runs in a command-line interface (CLI).

`run.py` is used to run the calculator. (Refer to [this article](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/) for how to run Python scripts.)

Currently, only basic functionality exists, but--at some point--I plan to ...
1. Add more mathematical operations (e.g., `^`, `sqrt`, and `exp`)
2. Develop a web application using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

And maybe it would be cool to develop a graphical user interface?
