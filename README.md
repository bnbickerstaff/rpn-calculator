# rpn-calculator
This is a [Reverse Polish notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator that runs in a command-line interface (CLI). Currently, only basic functionality exists, but--at some point--I plan to ...
1. Add more mathematical operations (e.g., `^`, `sqrt`, and `exp`)
2. Develop a web application using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

And maybe it would be cool to develop a graphical user interface?
